As a Web Developer, I was tasked with creating a custom static business website for a client. I leveraged my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SCSS to deliver a visually appealing solution that met the client's specific requirements.

The client requested a dramatic fade-in landing page with specific language and parameters, as well as four distinct sections to showcase their product, business background, family background, and local partners with links and Google Maps integration.

I utilized supplied workshop and family photos to create a stunning scrolling background and incorporated neutral colors and various visual animations, such as fades and slide-ins, to effectively showcase the client's chosen text and information. The website was fully optimized for responsiveness, ensuring an optimal user experience on any device.

The client was "incredibly" satisfied with the final result.

As the client has shifted away from online sales, we have replaced the sales/contact portion with local partners.
